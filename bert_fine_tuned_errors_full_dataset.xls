yeah,0.0,1
I 'm having some I would n't mind three slices of toast I 'm quite hungry how do we do three slices of toast ?,0.0,1
well pirate is probably a bad thing so,1.0,0
yeah I think the first thing I 'll do when I get back is erm try and get hold of a lawyer who can speak English to handle my application and my resident 's permit,0.0,1
mm,0.0,1
ah it 's difficult is n't it I mean I think I was always a worry for my parents you know cos I was always really quiet and I was and I was always popular cos I was always good at sport and you I always I always did well at school but I I always felt I always wanted to be a loner even though I was n't a loner but I always kind of wanted to be so I just kinda sat there in class not saying anything and not answering questions and things and and for me yeah for me that was cos of my upbringing cos I live with weird stuff going on I suppose,0.0,1
yeah,0.0,1
and it 's sad because he never had his own parents so he kind of just lost s- s- lost another family so I feel sorry for him --UNCLEARWORD,0.0,1
uhu,0.0,1
because it is about the use of English language some of them --UNCLEARWORD was they 're particularly interested in young people and teenagers and how they spoke so next w-,1.0,0
ooh less less than that --ANONnameM oh oh no that 's fine just coffee is fine it 's just one the cocoa it was difficult no none none in coffee none,0.0,1
lads 'll just say,1.0,0
and that 's just to be around a child for a couple of hours I ca n't imagine doing what you 're doing and I ca n't I ca n't and obviously therefore I know deep down that I 'm not a good parent if I think that then I ca n't be a good parent that 's not what a parent should be so,0.0,1
so I 'd say that was on the news so I 'd say they when it happens it 'll probably be on there again,1.0,0
one of the boys head boy yeah,0.0,1
yeah I do n't I have no idea how to get to --ANONplace by public transport absolutely cos er my auntie,0.0,1

no he said I mean we saw them remember ?,1.0,0
I wish your mum was here where 's the bit at the bottom ?,0.0,1
mm,0.0,1
yes,0.0,1
all I know is my judgement about things feels clouded and the reason why I that 's not normal for me I 'm normally quite a decisive guy I 'm normally someone who does n't beat about the bush I 'm not someone who goes in twenty-four hours from blowing one way to blowing another I 'm normally really decisive I never have problems with making decisions right ? but the reason I did is obviously because something fucking complex is going on in there and that complex thing is toying with things and on the one hand dealing with the guilt of having ended it with you and hurt you clearly and on the other hand you know trying to trying to get on with life but also give you know give you the reasons why I feel the relationship er er needs to end so,0.0,1
yeah,0.0,1
and soon --ANONnameM I do believe next Friday you 'll be a clocked another one up,0.0,1

hence why we 're asking about the oven so how 's your hand ?,0.0,1
oh yeah but I have,0.0,1
no no,1.0,0
so we all went back through the system we were in before the public school but we said look if we do this then we have to get a uni job the next year which we did so when we got that uni job we kind of thought well a year 's not really long enough at uni kinda so we 're potentially gon na do a couple of years but then there were a lot of there was a lot of hoo-ha with maybe people were gon na get fired or laid off so,0.0,1
I have the same we have the same trouble with a with like a big group of us if a few of them ca n't make it you fe- like we have we all try and push it like oh you know we 'll still do it we 'll still do it like,0.0,1

almost like a finishing school,1.0,0

yeah star- started my love for Christian Bale,0.0,1
yeah they used to just like the teachers used to try and stop them and they used to just do stuff,0.0,1
yeah ?,1.0,0
and I hate that I cos as a student I read the feedback you know and I I looked at it and I did all some of these big key words you know you you can reflected on it and I looked at it and I saw it as a map and all that sort of stuff and it was you know a design to get me to the next stage and these academics who just tick and we used to hate it the students there was a there was a group of us er myself and my friends and this is probably where the my biggest advantage lies I believe is because I 'm s- relatively close to being the student most of the academics here are so so distant erm both in a time sense and almost in a physical sense in the sense that they have they 've no interest in it so they do n't put themselves out over students they have no interest in the students whatsoever but just in the time sense like it 's twenty years since they learned and the reality is the context in which they learn is completely different to today,0.0,1
man you go to fucking Marks and Spencer 's and you can spend three fifty on a like portion of soup in a premade packet that 's made in a fucking factory,1.0,0

so can I can I add my two pennies worth ? okay with men they clearly I think men are very very good at distinguishing erm what other men are trying to achieve yeah ? they 're pretty clear I think in the cut in when you get to be a manager you start to wield some power yeah you either like it or you do n't hopefully you do like it yeah otherwise you would n't do it but from the guys as as you call it you know the types of words you 'd use when you were talking about engineers with senior engineers or or management in engineering companies swing their dicks around suck my cock you know the way you would actually describe these people you were working with you know or in meetings with it sounded horrendous it sounded really like too fucking much in many ways yeah and what I did n't like about it was it was so male dominated it was so much male talk it was so much like I 'm an alpha male you 're not you 're be you 're a whatever so you 're gon na have to follow me because basically I 've got the power shut up fuck off and you 'll do what I say yeah ? and that male dominated world I 'm sorry if you do n't fit into it it 's shit it 's crap it 's it 's got ta be one of the worst places to be if you 're if you wan na be your own man yeah like most men want to be their own men who wants to actually just roll over and go yeah fuck off I just wan na be erm dominated by another man no you do n't what what man really wants to be dominated by another man ? I mean really I do n't want to be fucking dominated by another woman so my idea of this psyche the driver is that actually sometimes it gets to the point where I 'm not management I 'm fucking off I 'm gon na be my own fucking boss because no fucking man is going to fucking talk to me like that,1.0,0
well I 've kind of found one already but,0.0,1

erm,0.0,1
so I am responsible for all the education liaison that the company does so at the moment there is an enormous erm shortage of engineers in the UK so my role is to work with schools universities put events on and increasingly work with er at government level on this issue around shortage of of erm engineers so it 's sort of divided into quarters really erm in those four areas so it 's because --ANONplace realise that they had to do something there was always bits that went on but nobody was coordinating it and nobody was actually giving a strategy to it nobody just knows what the other person was doing cos it 's a company that works very much in silos you know they 've got these fifteen sixteen divisions that all work in silos and do n't very often cross fertilise so er all the education stuff that they were doing nobody knew what was happening either so it was a bit ridiculous so you 'd be in contact with --ANONplace and have a conversation and somebody 'd say oh yes somebody from your company rang last week and we 've done this this and this and you think oh well I want you to do this this and this and nobody does repeat so you know so they were all getting irritated and there 's no particular cu- cohesion and strategy with erm with schools either so that 's sort of really what I do and I 've just built I started absolutely nothing completely blank nobody had ever done the job before,1.0,0
and I wanted to get this particular one so I went to the tourist office and I said have you got any any you know any of these posters and I showed them a photo of the one that I was looking for and she said well there 's there 's er French lady really she was she 's given me a great big folder she says you can have them all if you want,0.0,1

that 's alright sun 's coming out,1.0,0
yes,0.0,1
like people of their calibre,0.0,1
the only thing is though yes you know of course what he went through is you now terrible and wrong but the the opposite end of it is the superinjunctions which are even sort of worse and I me- you know I I understand why they 're used but they 're just abused by celebrities who do n't want their extramarital affairs being news right ? now that that sort of I find those really sort of erm,0.0,1

it 's something to do with the ownership,1.0,0
yeah,0.0,1
it 's like say if I made tea but I made it in different ways each time and then,0.0,1
but the the moral of the story of that was if you do n't like something you can completely change it,1.0,0
mm I do n't like miniature spiders do you know why I do n't like miniature ones ?,0.0,1
I know,0.0,1

I went er,0.0,1
oh was it ?,0.0,1
and by the end of the second week I think er --ANONnameF had pretty much fallen out,1.0,0
mm,0.0,1
yeah but I thought that the erm family that that played,1.0,0
oh is it just one one cha- one of these things that you ?,0.0,1
yeah,0.0,1
oh,0.0,1
ca n't see it so well in here yeah it 's all scratched cos obviously this is very cheap it 's all scratched,0.0,1
yeah --ANONnameM,1.0,0
well there 's not authority no authority in the parenting,0.0,1
yeah I can smell it ?,1.0,0
cos he 's an interesting man is n't he ? he 's like,0.0,1
he he improved so much and then --ANONnameM even said that he 's improved but no one 's told me that I 've improved even though I 've got a set off him,0.0,1
no,0.0,1
yeah,0.0,1
but this is it I mean everything 's available all year round although I do find in Lidl they are quite seasonal,0.0,1
yeah so you get to the Co-op and the left and then when you come out you 're opposite the road that goes towards the Grand Arcade,1.0,0
oh they 're quite pretty I think,0.0,1
basically yeah your phone 's just like a personal organiser now you just it organises your life,0.0,1
who knows who knows,1.0,0
and then I did one but they only did half of what I originally intended to do so in future I 'm not sure that it 's actually I was planning to do the one where I did the eighty and then the hundred,0.0,1
yeah yeah well it 's just,1.0,0
--UNCLEARWORD oh okay,0.0,1
yeah per hour,1.0,0
so I 've had to make that that 's a sacrifice that --ANONnameF is worth making so,0.0,1
yeah,0.0,1
there 's no cheating with the timer although some people do like to cheat with the timer,1.0,0
yeah yeah,0.0,1
I think so yeah I think --ANONnameM sometimes prefers it when it 's a bit more intimate when there 's less of us,0.0,1
when but did you move last year as well while we went on holiday like this ? when you,0.0,1
oh,0.0,1
well do n't rub it love,1.0,0

and Stairway to Heaven was one I always remember,0.0,1
mm,0.0,1
yes you used to have trouble did n't you ?,0.0,1
yeah,0.0,1

no no well my mum has n't got one yet,0.0,1

I feel bad cos I feel like I 'm I 'm trying to tag you in but that 's not what I 'm saying but I mean you look at most adults that have children everyone I know probably has like three close friends and then that 's it,0.0,1
oh yeah yeah yeah yeah,1.0,0
yeah,0.0,1
yeah,0.0,1

oh,0.0,1
so that must be in a village or a town,1.0,0
no,0.0,1
you know they still they still execute people on a on a monthly basis and to New Yorkers it 's er barbaric completely different mindset completely different culture and if you think in terms of miles how far away it is it 'd be like someone in England comparing themselves to someone in Romania the,1.0,0

uhu,0.0,1
no,0.0,1

yeah,0.0,1
he 's like some,1.0,0

let me finish this one first and then I 'll decide no if you get it done --ANONnameM who in Magaluf who 's got his tattoo licence like last last night you know it 's gon na look rubbish but if you get it from a proper,0.0,1

in the end they gave her one of these jump suits to wear you know while her clothes were in a big bag and I thought to myself yeah it 's on balance it 's probably worth it to get one of those jumpsuits,0.0,1
yeah,0.0,1
I 'm not sure what the deal is,1.0,0
yeah,0.0,1
all going slowly and thinking when you and there 's nothing visible,1.0,0
that 's like a pound cheaper,1.0,0
oh,0.0,1
that 's what --ANONnameM said but when I pointed out moving the same weekend he was like oh,0.0,1

but you 've got to go into --ANONplace first,1.0,0
I suppose it was well what were they made of ? I mean why did they ?

yeah yeah,0.0,1
you know she 's come from a you know I 'm not saying that anybody comes from a well upbringing has n't got experience to give to the table but it 's not and she just irritates me cos she 's just that classic sort of like practiced erm sort of script and it 's like erm it was she was defending well she was n't defending the guy who said that you know but just she 's oh it annoys me because at the at the grass roots of it all no matter how they say they 're all very like Labour and that and Tories are very similar Tories believe in an organic system where you have your rich and your poor and it 's oh well get over the no do you know what I mean ? at the end of the day that 's the core values of it,0.0,1
w- well you could you c- you you 've got ta be --UNCLEARWORD a bit of an architect you 've got ta create something really quite interesting and you 've got ta get people on board and,1.0,0
yeah but,0.0,1
mm,0.0,1
mm we got a new gas --UNCLEARWORD,1.0,0
what I started doing cos it happened where I felt maybe when I had less experience I would 've noticed it and probably thought it was something to do with whatever I you might see someone for two weeks three weeks and then they disappear again so you never really know how they develop but there 's this one guy in I just he was with us for a while so what I started to do was erm a lot of text like set text you can like like sort of graded reading you can you can actually download from most publisher 's websites in,0.0,1

yeah,0.0,1
I really do n't get this cos cos okay so so you 're saying there 's this system okay and yes it 's sort of the vast majority benefits men but part of that system that we 've now realised is because men are in these positions of power they feel an inclination to not fail as much and therefore because of that pressure more men commit suicide than women,0.0,1
yeah,0.0,1
okay more more forms,1.0,0
quite rightly you know they were very irresponsible in lending,1.0,0

yeah,0.0,1
so um I can really use up to one percent if I want so in a hundred percent I 'd use w- up to one percent which would be one mil so if I say because my mask has got water in it there 's more chance of contamination so I think I should do my pricing all based on one mil of preservative,1.0,0
yeah were you potty-trained ?,0.0,1

something --UNCLEARWORD Diet Coke,1.0,0
well no not from my point of view cos I 've always kind of thought well well part part of it is if I was doing my own thing my own business like I 've said erm it was about the location thing I always liked the idea of moving around because that kind of reinvigorates you it 's new stuff you learn new stuff it forces you to look at thing differently you try different stuff just because you 're doing that when you 're based in one place sure you get to know the community you become better known in the community you know more people there but you 're there and that 's it you know ? erm you do n't necessarily get the freedom to go and have a look around and look at other stuff and,0.0,1

mm,0.0,1
and the cost of maintaining equipment is so huge and schools do n't have often you know some sort of technical support officer who is capable of fixing say laptops that they become useless very quickly so what is introduced needs to be thought through very carefully,1.0,0
oh yeah,0.0,1
oh I do n't know our neighbour might,0.0,1
with wi- wi- with practice we developed a digit span of fif- no eighty items I 'm eight,1.0,0

well he is but your dad 's your dad 's never done the job so you do n't require any training for the job anybody can go out there and do it but the other thing I said you know to to do things like idiots do n't realise if that wagon turns up so you 've got your transport company and they arrive and your transport company are allowed two hours for offloading and after that they charge you what 's called demurrage waiting time,1.0,0
yeah I do n't really swim very much though,0.0,1

in the financial and a couple of young girls that we work with erm and there were two people there so that was the erm,0.0,1
was er on- once you got them together they f- fed off each other 's prejudi- prejudice and they were basically totally yeah if if she had 've if she had n't have been like that and she was not not had a problem with it she 'd have probably have said --ANONnameM do n't be so stupid it 's your it 's your grandchildren but she was racist too,0.0,1
yeah,0.0,1
you 're not gon na say something to him about saying stuff like that ?,1.0,0

yeah,0.0,1
I du n no my belt always beeps,1.0,0
was it the second day ?,0.0,1
--UNCLEARWORD I also think it 's I think it 's I think it 's simplifying it by being like well you know like by either saying by just saying like embrace embrace where you 're from the racial difference or the flip of like embrace the fact that you 're in this new place like just because you 're part of a group does n't mean you feel like you 're part of the group right ?,1.0,0
no I have n't been to see no,0.0,1
of course,1.0,0
yeah,0.0,1
yeah the world is actually flat and it 's only like a few square kilometres,0.0,1
and it was er I think our friend who had been staying around like she just like she just drinks ketchup,0.0,1

absolutely full so,0.0,1
no,0.0,1
no to like their granny not their great granny,0.0,1
er but it 's to- run totally separate to the NHS which runs NHS continuing care of with the criteria seems to me to be very complicated and I ca n't understand erm I ca n't understand the complexity of it so people do n't know why they get it and why they do n't get it etcetera etcetera but often people with a terminal illness can get fast tracked and get NHS continuing care money which can then provide a huge care package for them for at home now often they use the same care nurs- n- care and nursing agencies as the social care budgets do,0.0,1
I mean it 's a moot point now cos they wo n't be able to collect it and fix it in time by the time he goes anyway so,0.0,1
okay,0.0,1
oh right,1.0,0
I mean that 's I suppose it 's something,1.0,0
oh really ?,0.0,1

but I 've lent a few out perfor- someone 's got Performance which really pisses me off,0.0,1
okay just get it all on all of that mixture,1.0,0

we found with with having that bird food all out there now cos I mean we 're s- we 're sort of filling it up all the time now we get I mean the starlings come a couple of times a day the young ones they always come,1.0,0
yeah,0.0,1
okay,0.0,1
but I do n't like quoting other people 's words it 's one thing as well it 's kind of like doing English literature where you just look at other people 's works whereas at school I always wanted to just write my own stuff,0.0,1
uhu,0.0,1
oh right,1.0,0
but she 's the first one in eighteen seventy-one farmer of four hundred and fifty acres who went to --ANONplace,1.0,0

some of that housing is cos it 's quite nice,0.0,1
she knows what she knows what a simile is she knows what they are,1.0,0
it 's like that was bonkers,1.0,0
yes I think you 'd have to choose your routes well --UNCLEARWORD,0.0,1
think how fucking how much work has gone into a blueprint that 's why it costs so much,1.0,0
yeah cos she never gets that she always gets the negative stuff,0.0,1
that that yeah I 'm glad you related that to what we were talking about cos when you first mentioned it I thought wow that 's a real lateral jump,1.0,0
sounds as if they 've collared --ANONnameF for the day,0.0,1
did she go through like the what is it ? the seven stages of grief ?,0.0,1
yeah,0.0,1
bargain cos they 're not there,0.0,1
however as you 've just poin- pointed out looking at the area and what 's there and objections from whoever now obviously most of the people round there are tenants,0.0,1
could be getting Pizza Express,1.0,0
it did n't it did n't work no,1.0,0
yeah,0.0,1
yeah,0.0,1
and I still do n't really completely agree with a lot of the ethics in it but as a as a s- a day out and stuff that 's really kind of,0.0,1
er but yeah you can only grow it under licence ?,1.0,0
so you you 're inside it ?,1.0,0
that 's what he said he was like,0.0,1
oh they do ?,1.0,0
from then on we had lovely weather and erm in --ANONplace and er the --ANONplace peninsula they are beautiful they are really beautiful and everyone was er all the locals was so nice it was n't you know when we went for a pub and that kind of thing and then,0.0,1

I 'm sure we 've just sort of inadvertently drove past that psychopath and I forgot should 've been a bit more cautious er I assume we 're gon na encounter diversion signs ? Cos I 'm gon na follow the A66 unless something else emerges,0.0,1
but they 've dredged that one out and you can it 's a leisure canal now though,1.0,0
oh right oh,0.0,1
no,0.0,1
just getting a bit sensitive there,1.0,0
yeah but they j- I would n't like anyone i- in the Ku Klux Klan because I think even if they 're not doing violence now they 're they 're they 're happily being part of an organisation that that did murder black people and and they 're happy to be associated with that it 's not very nice it 's like it 's like being a member of a hate organisation really is n't it ? but yeah those are Southern states so that 's pro- that 's one of the reasons why to Kill a Mockingbird is it 's set in the place with the kind of there 'll be places li- like the the author wrote it where she b- was brought up was probably pretty similar it 's sad as well is n't it ?,1.0,0
--ANONplace was yeah yeah,1.0,0
mm,0.0,1

erm,0.0,1
because they wanted to be the first ones,0.0,1
well hang on a minute,1.0,0
unless yeah,1.0,0
well she of course I think --ANONnameF used to say I think she was n't all that happy when he did home,0.0,1
oh --ANONnameF ?,0.0,1
yeah,0.0,1

oh,0.0,1
oh chips,0.0,1
well I 'll just get bitten wo n't I ?,1.0,0

okay erm can I I 'll leave the fruit and veg yeah ?,0.0,1
yeah but again it 's turning itself round so,1.0,0
but you know if you said good night go to bed as it were you do n't then stare at your computer screen usually you just er,0.0,1
mm,0.0,1
oh,0.0,1
um it is one person from uh,1.0,0
you ca n't back out now --ANONnameF,0.0,1
well,1.0,0
I think yes it 's worked out really good,0.0,1
not that I 'm aware of,1.0,0
that is nothing to brag about,1.0,0
so it 's getting good sounds I 'm going to turn it up okay so let 's just see how this goes so erm I I think that he had a very rounded message that er had some interesting things in it that one could explore,0.0,1
it means that like it 's twe- like it 's good,0.0,1
yeah,0.0,1
it was quite small the glasses Yeah,1.0,0
no,0.0,1
yeah,0.0,1
he 's very keen all the time you know he brings something,1.0,0
spent three days going to --ANONplace I leave at twenty past six get in twenty past seven and leave at four so,0.0,1
well we met him in John Lewis,1.0,0
so it 's not a predisposition to be,1.0,0
yeah,0.0,1
he 's not consistent enough is he ?,1.0,0
--UNCLEARWORD knob uh,1.0,0
yeah I said to --UNCLEARWORD,0.0,1
yeah and then when his --UNCLEARWORD he become grandad --UNCLEARWORD,0.0,1
not as nice as --ANONnameF cat its basically,0.0,1
and kill you yeah,1.0,0
uhu,0.0,1
yeah,0.0,1
basically --ANONnameF 's got all her extra holiday --UNCLEARWORD now she 's a teacher rather than support staff she gets all the six-week holidays off bar four days --UNCLEARWORD,0.0,1
mm,0.0,1
you could have knocked me down with a feather I mean my dad was mad,1.0,0
yeah,0.0,1
er he looked to me like he was in his mid-forties,0.0,1
cos he 's not thinking about,0.0,1
and also coming back on the train there were train like roadworks so I had to catch a connection and like run for that and get on a bus and go somewhere else so,0.0,1
there was someone launching fireworks last night actually did you ?,0.0,1
no just like my friend is the guy 's like they 're f- they 're for me --ANONnameM ?,0.0,1
hopefully there is something yeah,1.0,0
yeah,0.0,1
three thousand words by the twenty-second of February,0.0,1
yeah but it 's finding the people you 've got to be able to find enough people I mean although I have I can apparently record people an infinite amount of times I still think that I 'd like to make the research as varied as possible therefore I should get as many people as I can so although I will record all of my family and all my friends numerous times I will do probably make an effort to meet with random people that I do n't know,0.0,1
yes but obviously you do n't need to worry about that quite as much on an A road because the dual carriageway,0.0,1
oh what 's it say ?,0.0,1
what he bought the first,1.0,0
but there 's no such thing as a free lu-,0.0,1
no no tha- er occasionally there would be long smooth,1.0,0
actually have I ? I might not have actually I 've just changed my mind,0.0,1
like about twenty years ago and he 's lived he 's got a massive house and it 's like with quite a bit of land,0.0,1
er g- I think he might 've ran again but not on the s- mm no maybe not maybe not erm but you know er yeah exactly cos he 's just like a bit of a semi-celebrity now is n't he ?,0.0,1

yeah yes,0.0,1
mm,0.0,1
oh they do n't normally get anything though cos they 're rotten by the,0.0,1
yeah you can understand it though,1.0,0
I but I think it 's like that at --ANONplace but especially because,0.0,1
oh,0.0,1
so I guess they weighed up should we do it because the people who want it are our voters but they probably realised the amount of people who were against it,0.0,1
no,0.0,1
why are you not working ?,0.0,1
oh,0.0,1
you know to us but everyone was quite confused when we put up on Facebook that we got married cos I wanted to skip the whole proposal bit for me it 's a bit like a get-out clause we got proposed but we do n't you know there 's still time I could break up with her we 're not actually married yet,0.0,1
oh right yes,0.0,1
but that 's different but erm if you do n't have any comeback off him it 's it 's tricky,1.0,0
it 's weird how none of their prices ever drop and they all move it up at the same time,0.0,1
and I have n't said it to him except that I I said that erm I did n't feel anything about it except negative things from being near the cotton mills and the er and also it it 's like a strange weird thing but as if it 's a a barrier being the other side of the M6 it 's all,1.0,0
you might as well like there 's no point,0.0,1
I I 'm not,1.0,0
yeah no he 's a good good talker,1.0,0
no and we ca n't do much anyway cos --ANONnameF it would mean one of us went out and the other one stayed at home so that 's shit so I mean,0.0,1
just just you know he 's but,1.0,0
I 'm gon na give it a wipe first and then just,0.0,1
did you ? oh,1.0,0
erm I do n't wan na go and see them separately I do n't wan na have to go all the way out to --ANONnameF and then and I 'm having to organise it with the two of them,0.0,1
one a day it 's horrible is n't it ? so they must have a pretty routine response for it it must kind of,0.0,1
there probably is yeah,1.0,0
yeah,0.0,1
yeah,0.0,1
taking the crap facing another woman,0.0,1
mm,0.0,1
