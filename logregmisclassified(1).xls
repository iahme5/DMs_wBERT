got ta be one reason for keeping you,1.0,0.0
no no we 'll would we 'll we 'll figure out a frequency that will be enough to keep it ticking along,1.0,0.0
they 've had one the book plans for doing it for so long but there 's always been so much protest over what would have to be done cos it goes through so many middle of the nothing places and eh it 's been put back and put back and put back and put back you know but I mean the there 's some very basic stuff that they could do which would make it so much better you know getting rid of all of these at grey junctions so like Catthorpe Interchange and all of those junctions where you 're coming down everything 's coming down to nothing and then winds through a tiny little bit and then go again you know get rid of them and make them grade separated junctions where the A fourteen carries on and it 's just people then come off and it would make it a lot easier but eh but yeah I think they 're going to have to get a lot more money just to overcome all the the protest and wooha there is in the different areas and yeah probably the only way to do that is to to say oh yeah we 're going to have it operated and maintained by a company that 's going to fund it you know so I would n't be surprised if you know probably some of my lot end up coming up with something of how they could do it fund it and operate it you know PFIs are a lot of the things these days so just having a taste see if it was poisoned,0.0,1.0
well at least there 's not too much of an er an atmosphere now you know,1.0,0.0

yes you would n't feel embarrassed by yes exact- that 's right yes,0.0,1.0
ooh this is quite difficult,0.0,1.0
or if they dramatise something in a way that was different to how I had imagined it,1.0,0.0
no yeah same,1.0,0.0
that 's right,1.0,0.0
that 's not possible though surely ?,1.0,0.0
yeah,1.0,0.0
first official night in a bed well that sounds quite exciting,0.0,1.0
oh my god their cocktails are so good like we had a long me and --ANONnameM we had a Long Island Ice Tea last Saturday,0.0,1.0
of Japanese medical system so I mean it 's,1.0,0.0
I do n't know if I even wan na live in this country to be honest I do n't not I du n no I would n't mm not convinced about the quality of life here to be honest,1.0,0.0
because I do n't have to be around them a long time I worked with children I spent quite a considerable time with children I do n't really like children they quite massively inhibit on my ability to do the things that I want to do I like being arou- around well I 'm I think I am good with children I know how to interact with children and I 'm happy to play with them temporarily but,0.0,1.0
so how many could they take ? how many pupils could they take there ?,1.0,0.0
so yeah it 's difficult oh Tembo come here come on,1.0,0.0
Super Immunity it 's called,1.0,0.0

oh is that what you mean ? Oh oh do n't worry about that,0.0,1.0
it 's just it 's just the the clearest thing for me cos I think that feedback we give students is like a map er feedback we give students if literally like you 're at point A and we want you to get to point B and these are all the things you did wrong which is why you 're not at point B okay ? and these are all the things you did right which got you to point A,0.0,1.0

they 're not gon na stop people with kids going in,0.0,1.0
but --ANONnameM like if you 're gon na be in the EU it you know in some sense it 's not fair that Germany should take millions and us take none surely it should be split pro rata between all the EU countries depending on their population and then Germany would n't have so many you know countries like Croatia and England who 've totally ignored it would have their fair share and it would n't be such a pressure on certain countries who are taking more in because that 's been their decision,1.0,0.0
and now I get all the references cos I did n't watch Game Of Thrones there,0.0,1.0

and thank you for that new belt as well,0.0,1.0
so I said --ANONnameM and he just turns around and looks at me like that was a bit er I ca n't remember the word now a bit odd,0.0,1.0
right er well I I think part of the reason is that erm fortunately from my side of of the coin some of the imperatives are n't there on the context of erm if you have to if you have to graft and you have to earn money and you 've got a family to er to to care for then the prerogative is bringing in money day in day out that 's just it you know ? so erm,0.0,1.0
where did I put my glass ? it 's not there,0.0,1.0
well what there 's you ca n't get out the village any other way,1.0,0.0

yeah well you ca n't blame them can you ?,1.0,0.0
so people wan na talk about mental health and erm I think and --ANONnameF suggested mental health people wan na talk about homelessness I do n't care about poverty and inequality erm the wellbeing sessions are connected to that cos it 's kind of about just building a responsibility so the way Miss --ANONnameN cos I asked her what shall I do ? cos so many ideas,0.0,1.0

but eh yes I I think you know when when membership of the EU first took off and erm our visits to employers became European so we all trundled off round --ANONplace and --ANONplace and --ANONplace visiting all these employers cos everybody thought oh they 're all going to get jobs over here well I mean it did n't happen did it ? cos the cultures and the education systems do n't fit so erm ah you know we were there 's there 's a lot of them who want their first job abroad and by far and away you know if you want to go abroad at all costs then the easiest thing to get into is teaching English because you 've got that 's your skill that you can offer in many countries is you know highly desirable erm or erm it there were students we have a lot of international students as well who 've got you know erm a cross between different nationalities and so on who 've got their own networks and so on erm they also I think benefit by getting a masters level in the UK if they 're wanting to go abroad because that four years would have been in France the minimum four years of HE and if you 've done one of your years is a placement I do n't think they really that 's not really counted so just staying on and doing a masters is is the one thing that can help but erm there were I mean we used to have all the you know all the websites and things for getting a graduate job in all these countries but the the record of people actually succeeding in any area other than teaching would be pitiful absolutely pitiful,1.0,0.0
oh course you are yeah,1.0,0.0

as fitting as it might sound the plural of moose is not and never has been meese,1.0,0.0
I think the only thing with iPhones they try and be unique to them do n't they to Apple it 's just,1.0,0.0
plus I know I 've mentioned before cos you kinda get the AA or the RAC to do like a a check on a car for you you can actually pay them to do it and that I think if you 're investing such a lot of money it might be worth paying for that service if you and just just to check it out I do n't know cos these days it 's di- it 's different I mean years ago you had you could read in fact was it on What Car ? or was it What Car ? where you can read a whole thing all about the what to look for when you 're looking at cars and what to check out and all the rest of it and,1.0,0.0

thing is I 've been reading a bit about computational linguistics and it 's really difficult for them to make this software because it 's all well and good saying you know they can make the they can understand the words but the problem is polysemy which words that have various meanings that come from the same root so if I say just a sentence on its own oh I 'm feeling really high right now you do n't know if high means mashed on drugs or if it means literally altitude that high and the problem with the all languages is that there is so much polysemy so it 's really difficult for a computer programme to know which word you 're saying then you have connected speech the computer programme needs to be able to take apart our words it 's we know that we 're speaking in separate words but actually it 's completely connected there 's no break in the speech so it 's,0.0,1.0
