yeah the lid like it 's vacuum sealed on so you have to ping it off I think I do n't really know I did the vacuum sealing bit and then I assumed it would all come off as one bit but I had to sort of,0.0,1
I did n't know what to do for some people so I just thought I 'm gon na make something gon na make chutney I 've never made chutney before,0.0,1

I have no idea,0.0,1
first time I got these jars I do n't really know how they work,0.0,1
it 's cos I tried to rush it I tried to do it too quickly and it I think it 's gon na need another couple of months so I I tried it out and it 's just it 's just not finished it 's pretty horrible really,0.0,1
mm mm,0.0,1
I 'm just amazed that you did n't si- like I she had specific instruction not to go in the larder and went into the larder like repeatedly,0.0,1
so hard to believe,0.0,1
mm,0.0,1
mm,0.0,1
that we 'd be able to drink together no,0.0,1
mm,0.0,1
mm,0.0,1
oh yeah cos that,0.0,1
it used to be like the mega easy way of choosing which wine to get because you would n't have to really bother looking at the leaflet,0.0,1
mm,0.0,1
just happened to taste absolutely awful,0.0,1
it was just the worst thing,0.0,1
like what 's the wine ?,0.0,1
yeah,0.0,1
yeah,0.0,1
yeah,0.0,1
I 'm not entirely sure how it goes with this but,0.0,1

I 'm not into like chocolate or like,0.0,1
taste person,0.0,1
I du n no sweet chocolatey type things but apple pies and things,0.0,1
mm yeah,0.0,1
n- n- not really,0.0,1
yeah I do n't mind like I 'd o- I normally prefer like tomato pur√©e in place of ketchup,0.0,1
that 's not as bad as the barbecue that we had though,0.0,1
like the condiments were all just missing,0.0,1
and it was er I think our friend who had been staying around like she just like she just drinks ketchup,0.0,1
and we we had had like this enormous thing and it was just,0.0,1
gone and none of us had noticed,0.0,1
it was kind of a disaster yeah it al- it did n't quite ruin the barbecue but people were definitely judging it harshly for us,0.0,1
they 've got where did all of this food and alcohol but they do n't have tomato ketchup what is wrong with them ?,0.0,1
oh yes --ANONnameM 's house,0.0,1
mm,0.0,1
so really they could n't complain too much I guess,0.0,1
I 'm just right,0.0,1
yeah all good thank you,0.0,1
I have skiing socks on and just the most enormously warm slippers,0.0,1

mm I am,0.0,1
so are you,0.0,1
I s- stuck in to the wine as well,0.0,1
I 'm just liking the lack of bacon,0.0,1
it has been a very rich sort of weekend,0.0,1
no it is Christmas so you 're meant to have rich food at Christmas but,0.0,1
mm,0.0,1
nice that is nice wine as well thank you very much it 's quite nice is n't it ?,0.0,1
so what was the conclusion with the wine thing should you pour it ? is it,0.0,1
better ? cos do n't know whether you and --ANONnameM doing like double blind trials or something,0.0,1
weird like where you whether you poured it between things or not,0.0,1
so it s- just changes it but not always for the better,0.0,1
yeah,0.0,1
yeah,0.0,1
yeah,0.0,1
yeah,0.0,1
why d' you not have like a big like screw top of it yeah so it can like ?,0.0,1
just really big corks,0.0,1
oh right I 'm quite jealous of anyone with a bath we do n't have one in our house,0.0,1
just have a shower,0.0,1
just feels weird having baths in other peoples ' baths though,0.0,1
it 's not is it not th- it just is it is a bit weird ?,0.0,1
just just is weird in general,0.0,1
oh yeah one of those,0.0,1
no,0.0,1
having a shower seems fine like it 's like yeah,0.0,1
I can have a shower it 's just fine but a bath 's just so much more,0.0,1
yeah,0.0,1
yeah,0.0,1
yeah it 's weird though you 're thinking it 's not weird because it was weird but since they 're not there it,0.0,1
yeah,0.0,1
either way it 'd be pretty hilarious if the police arrived and you were just lying in the bath,0.0,1
well like --ANONnameN --UNCLEARWORD for my birthday the other day,0.0,1
no like a look like it 's not like you 're going to get clean it 's just like,0.0,1
going for this experience so it 's a bit better really,0.0,1
and like hot tubs are just baths with bubbles are n't they ?,0.0,1
be more than happy to go in those I think though like if you 're ever in a hot tub with other people if you just turn off the bubbles then it 's just a bath with your friends and,0.0,1
I hope not,0.0,1
mm,0.0,1
I do n't really like either,0.0,1
I think I 've been put off both of them just by my gym and just going in and it 's just full of big hairy sweaty dudes and,0.0,1
that 's just not how I like spending my,0.0,1
whatever time it is so,0.0,1
no that 's the only one only time I have like access to them,0.0,1
I do quite like that actually jumping in between the pool and it,0.0,1
yeah I can see that,0.0,1
no it just depends who you 're sharing the sauna with,0.0,1
it 's just weird,0.0,1
mm,0.0,1
yeah,0.0,1
you look look really like relaxed there,0.0,1
I could be so mean in that situation so I could move you could be sitting there,0.0,1
and it was just like it was so well you finished and you 're just covered from head to toe in like just mud and just horrible horrible stuff,0.0,1
and it was just one of the greatest ones ever cos everyone was just so relieved to be out of the cold and out of the mud into this thi- they did n't care about the big lumps of poo and stuff,0.0,1
do n't wan na know what it is,0.0,1
yeah,0.0,1
how solid it is I think,0.0,1
the solidity of it I did n't think rabbit poo would be too bad but,0.0,1
yeah,0.0,1
mm,0.0,1
yeah,0.0,1
yeah that 's just,0.0,1
mm interesting,0.0,1
I 'm not sure,0.0,1
and chillies as well in fact,0.0,1
no thanks,0.0,1
no I 'm alright okay,0.0,1
no I 'm alright just want a bit of cheese or something,0.0,1
I 'm like I might just wan na just have a nose in,0.0,1
mm,0.0,1
well that was nice,0.0,1
did n't actually notice the orangey-ness that much though it was it was quite nice I think it tempered the sprouts,0.0,1
yes,0.0,1
no,0.0,1
but these really are er the Christmas ones were sort of alright-ish I guess I tried them but these are quite nice,0.0,1
yeah,0.0,1
these in as soon as they 're like even just a smidgen overdone,0.0,1
well that 's what --ANONnameN was saying I just did n't,0.0,1
yeah you need lots of gravy,0.0,1
yeah,0.0,1
yeah,0.0,1
no,0.0,1
mm again I think like that would just overdo her a bit cos curry needs cooking a long time,0.0,1
and they 're just kind of hidden and you think it 's like hidden healthiness,0.0,1
like kale I really do not like kale but it 's really good for you so if you just put it in a smoothie with like other stuff like avocado and banana you do n't even taste it,0.0,1
mm,0.0,1
oh yeah ? really ?,0.0,1
I love smoothies yeah I just find like it 's just the easiest way to get lots of greens really easily and tastily,0.0,1
yeah,0.0,1
I just like chewing things if it,0.0,1
I like smoothies for like the opposite reason cos you do n't have to chew them,0.0,1
smoothies just like weird somehow,0.0,1
so I will have all of my vegetables for today in these next three gulps,0.0,1
it 's like odd,0.0,1
yeah,0.0,1
yeah,0.0,1
mm,0.0,1
to an extent but I think just getting food in your belly just does the same thing anyway,0.0,1
a slightly lumpy smoothie that you have to chew,0.0,1
well the last one I had was rather was really nice though,0.0,1
if you have frozen stuff in it as well that does n't quite,0.0,1
my friend 's been on erm this thing called Soylent I do n't know if you 've heard about it ? it,0.0,1
it 's not that you poo the bed every night,0.0,1
erm no,0.0,1
but it 's like fully nutritionally balanced,0.0,1
erm there 've been people doing I know but like for a lot of people people do n't like cooking and they do n't like the effort,0.0,1
or they just do n't do it so they just end up having,0.0,1
pr- yeah so he eats like a couple of meals a week,0.0,1
and all of the rest of his meals are milkshakes and he 's been on that for about three months and apparently the first couple of weeks were a little bit weird and his body was adjusting to,0.0,1
like like going from eating actual food to just having liquid all the time,0.0,1
and now he just feels like better than ever like he 's just,0.0,1
apparently there 's a lot of people saying this as well and I do n't,0.0,1
but it 's probably quite good if you 're in a bit of a rush like just to get in a healthy meal,0.0,1
mm,0.0,1
apparently it 's not the tastiest thing,0.0,1
mm,0.0,1
mm like it makes lots of,0.0,1
yeah true but a lot of people just eat the same thing every day anyway or s- just eat Mcdonald 's or just eat whatever so I mean,0.0,1
yeah,0.0,1
I find it hard to believe if you 're having like a proper healthy diet then it would be better than that or as good as that,0.0,1
yeah,0.0,1
just like quite nice,0.0,1
yeah yeah I like it and I like,0.0,1
yeah he 's finally gotten some of it,0.0,1
yeah,0.0,1
yeah,0.0,1
oh yeah we had all the food but he does n't eat food any more so it was n't really for him,0.0,1
what do you do though if someone invites you in for dinner you 're like ?,0.0,1
well no he does still eat sometimes and he goes out,0.0,1
for meals and stuff it just,0.0,1
means that he 's spending his money on like he 'll go out for like a nice meal once a week instead or something,0.0,1
yeah,0.0,1
you could have another room,0.0,1
yeah,0.0,1
yeah,0.0,1
yeah I 'm tempted to just I 'm gon na check it out I think I do n't I 'd definitely not be doing it all the time but I definitely wan na see what it 's about and,0.0,1
mm,0.0,1

very m- it 's like oh that looks that would look really nice in my room,0.0,1
cos I do n't have enough light,0.0,1
maybe well I wanted them on my bed but I also thought since I have my pillow so high that that,0.0,1
and also the lighting in my room is n't very good at the moment,0.0,1
I do n't know which one that one is,0.0,1
no oh a thing,0.0,1

and oh yeah and there was --ANONnameF and --ANONnameM when they went for it,0.0,1

I do n't know any of these,0.0,1
oh oh I could 've guessed that one,0.0,1
I 'd love it if that was right,0.0,1

oh,0.0,1
oh right then,0.0,1
yeah,0.0,1
oh it 's close,0.0,1

oh,0.0,1
no,0.0,1
oh this one,0.0,1
oh what ?,0.0,1
not sure that 's allowed but it 's wrong anyway,0.0,1
